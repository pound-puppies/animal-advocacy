## Project description with goals
### Description
* Using the Austin Animal Center data from 2013 to present, our team will create a model to best predict whether an cat or dog will be adopted. The purpose is to give stakeholders (taxpayers, local government) can use the model as a tool to decide where to focus resources to increase adoption rates. The key is early intervention for cats/dogs to increase adoption resources on those with lower rates of adoption. 

### GoalsÂ¶
* Construct an email answering at least 4 questions 
* Deliver a final report with predictive model to the data science team 
* Deliver a slide with key points
* Deliver a predictive model any animal shelter can adopt

### Initial Thoughts
* We believe there are key features we possess in the data set such as breed, age, and others that will make a strong predictive model.

## Initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas

* 1. Does breed affect whether an animal will be adopted?
* 2. Does age affect whether an animal will be adopted?
* 3. Does tenure affect whether an animal will be adopted?
* 4. Does condition affect whether an animal will be adopted?
